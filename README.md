# Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Ayush.

A versatile Software Developer with a strong foundation in front-end development and a keen eye for user experience design. My primary language is **JavaScript**, and I specialize in creating dynamic, high-performance web applications using **React**, **Redux**, and **Node.js**.

With a deep understanding of object-oriented programming and modern development practices, I ensure my code is both organized and efficient. My expertise extends to technologies such as **React Native** for mobile applications, **Next.js** for scalable web solutions, and **TypeScript** for robust type safety. I can also integrate robust backend solutions like **Firebase**, **MongoDB**, and **Stripe**.

Beyond JavaScript frameworks, I‚Äôve developed strong skills in **UI/UX design**, using libraries like **Framer Motion** and **Three.js** to craft visually engaging and interactive experiences. My expertise in optimizing real-time features, secure user authentication, and third-party API integrations allows me to create modern, user-focused applications.

I have a particular interest in **game development**, where I've built a solid foundation in **game physics** and **3D mathematics**, bringing virtual worlds to life using engines like **Unity** and **Unreal**.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to witness the convergence of my passion, skills, and creativity.
