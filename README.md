# Hello! I am Ayush.

My primary language is C++. I've built a solid foundation in object-oriented programming, allowing me to create organized and efficient code. When it comes to game development, I have a good grasp of game physics and 3D mathematics, which I use to breathe life into virtual worlds.

I'm well-versed in commercial game engines like Unity and Unreal, where my expertise is growing steadily. Collaborating with these platforms, I'm driven to create seamless and captivating gameplay environments. As I continue to expand my horizons, I'm excited to contribute to the dynamic landscape of gaming by pushing the boundaries of interactive entertainment.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to witness the convergence of my passion, skills, and creativity in the realm of game development.
